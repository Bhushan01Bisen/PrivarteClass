======== java script variable ==========

In programming , a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.

ex. let num=5;
 

 =======Difference btw var and let=========

                   var                                                        let
1. var is used in the older version of javaScript         1. let is a new way of declaring variables
                                                                 starting ES6
2. var is function scoped.                                2. let is block scoped.
3. var allows to redeclare variables.                     3.let does not allow to redeclare variables.


============ Rules fo naming javaScript variables.===========

1. variable names must start with either a letter, an underscore_ or the dollar sign $.
2. Variable names cannot start with number.
3. javaScript is case-sensitive. So y and Y are different variable.
4. Keywords cannot be used as variable names.


=========== keywords which are Reserved ================

abstract	arguments	  await	           boolean
break	      byte	     case	            catch
char	     class*	     const	          continue
debugger	  default	 delete	             do
double	      else	      enum*	            eval
export   	 extends 	 false	           final
finally	      float	      for	         function
goto	        if	     implements	       import
in	       instanceof	     int	      interface
let 	       long	       native	          new
null	     package	  private	       protected
public      	return	    short	        static
super 	        switch	synchronized	      this
throw	        throws	transient	          true
try          	typeof   	var           	void
volatile     	while	    with	        yield 


# Though you can name variables in any way you want ,its a good practice to give a descriptive variable
  name .if you are using a variable to stored the number of apples,its better to use apples or numberOfApples
  rather than x or y.

# In javaScriptthe the variable names are generally written in camelCase if it has multiple words.
  for ex. firstName , annualSalary


  ======== javaScript Constants ==========

  once a constant is initialized, we cannot change its value.
  simply a constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed.


  =========== If....else Statement ===========

  in  computer programming there may arise situation where you have to run a block of code among more 
  than one alternatives.

  ex. assigning grades A,B or C based on marks obtained by a student.
  in such a situation you can use javaScript. If...else statement to create a program that can make decisions.

  In JS there are three forms of If..else
  1. If statement
  2. If....else statement
  3. If...else if ...else statement

  Syntax of the if Statement is:

  If (condition) {
    //body of if statement
  }


 # Condition is true                              # condition is false
 
  let num = 2;                                    let num = -2;
  if (num >0){                                    if (num>0){   
   //code                                          //code
  }                                                }
  //code after if                                  //code after if


 ============= JavaScript if...else if statement =====================

 The if...else statement is used to execute a block of code among two alternatives. 
 However, if you need to make a choice between more than two alternatives,
  if...else if...else can be used.

  The syntax of the if...else if...else statement is:

if (condition1) {
    // code block 1
} else if (condition2){
    // code block 2
} else {
    // code block 3
}

If condition1 evaluates to true, the code block 1 is executed.
If condition1 evaluates to false, then condition2 is evaluated.
If the condition2 is true, the code block 2 is executed.
If the condition2 is false, the code block 3 is executed.


=================== What is a Ternary operator? ===================
A ternary operator evaluates a condition and executes a block of code based on the condition.

Its syntax is:
condition ? expression1 : expression2

The ternary operator evaluates the test condition.

If the condition is true, expression1 is executed.
If the condition is false, expression2 is executed.
The ternary operator takes three operands, hence, the name ternary operator. 
It is also known as a conditional operator.


=============== JavaScript Loop ================
in programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code.

For example, if you want to show a message 100 times, then you can use a loop. 
It's just a simple example; you can achieve much more with loops.

The syntax of the for loop is:
for (initialExpression; condition; updateExpression) {
    // for loop body
}

1. The initialExpression initializes and/or declares variables and executes only once.
2. The condition is evaluated.
   # If the condition is false, the for loop is terminated.
   # If the condition is true, the block of code inside of the for loop is executed.
3. The updateExpression updates the value of initialExpression when the condition is true.
4. The condition is evaluated again. This process continues until the condition is false


const n = 5;

for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    console.log(`I love JavaScript.`);
}

Here is how this program works.

Iteration	Variable	Condition: i <= n	Action
1st	i = 1
n = 5	true	I love JavaScript. is printed.
i is increased to 2.
2nd	i = 2
n = 5	true	I love JavaScript. is printed.
i is increased to 3.
3rd	i = 3
n = 5	true	I love JavaScript. is printed.
i is increased to 4.
4th	i = 4
n = 5	true	I love JavaScript. is printed.
i is increased to 5.
5th	i = 5
n = 5	true	I love JavaScript. is printed.
i is increased to 6.
6th	i = 6
n = 5	false	The loop is terminated.
