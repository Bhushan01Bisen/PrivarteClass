===Java Variables and Constants===============
javaScript Variable 

In programing, a variable is a container (storage area ) to hold data

ex;let   num=5;

========diffrent betw. them.=============

             var                                                      let
var is used in the older version of                                    let is new way of decleration variable 
javaScript                                                             srarting ES6

let is block-scoped.                                                    var is function scoped.
					                                                   
			
let does not allow to redeclare variables.                              var allows to redeclare variables.
					                                                   
			
Hoisting does not occur in let.                                         Hoisting occurs in var.
					                                                    
==========RUles for Naming JavaScript Variable =============================

RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLE 

1.Variable name start with either a letter ,an underscore ... ir the doller sign $
2.Variable names cannot start with numbers.
3. javaScript is case-Sensetive .so y and Y are diff Variables
4. Keywords cannot be use as variables names


=========== keywords which are Reserved ================
abstract	arguments	    await	           boolean
break	      byte	      case	            catch
char	     class*	      const	          continue
debugger	 default	    delete	             do
double	    else	      enum*	            eval
export   	 extends 	    false	           final
finally	    float	      for	         function
goto	       if	        implements	       import
in	       instanceof	  int	      interface
let*	       long	      native	          new
null	     package	    private	       protected
public      	return	  short	        static
super 	        switch	synchronized	      this
throw	        throws	  transient	          true
try          	typeof   	var           	void
volatile     	while	    with	        yield


*****Notes:***
* Through you can name variable in any way you wont, its good practice to give a descriptive variable .if you are using a variable to store the numbers of apples,it better tp use apples or nuber OF Apples rather than x or n .

*IN JavaScript, the variable names are generally written in camelCase if it has multiple wprds. For example,firstName,annualSalary.


JavaScript Constants

the const keywords was 

once a constant is initialized, we cannot change its value.
  simply a constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed.



=========== If....else Statement ===========

  in  computer programming there may arise situation where you have to run a block of code among more 
  than one alternatives.

  ex. assigning grades A,B or C based on marks obtained by a student.
  in such a situation you can use javaScript. If...else statement to create a program that can make decisions.

  In JS there are three forms of If..else
  1. If statement
  2. If....else statement
  3. If...else if ...else statement


============JavaScript Statemenrt=================


# Condition is true                              # condition is false
 
  let num = 2;                                    let num = -2;
  if (num >0){                                    if (num>0){   
   //code                                          //code
  }                                                }
  //code after if                                  //code after if


  The if...else statement is used to execute a block of code among two alternatives. However, if you need to make a choice between more than two alternatives, if...else if...else can be used.

The syntax of the if...else if...else statement is:

if (condition1) {
    // code block 1
} else if (condition2){
    // code block 2
} else {
    // code block 3
}

    If condition1 evaluates to true, the code block 1 is executed.
    If condition1 evaluates to false, then condition2 is evaluated.
        If the condition2 is true, the code block 2 is executed.
        If the condition2 is false, the code block 3 is executed.


====What is a Ternary operator?=======

A ternary operator evaluates a condition and executes a block of code based on the condition.

Its syntax is:

condition ? expression1 : expression2

The ternary operator evaluates the test condition.

    If the condition is true, expression1 is executed.
    If the condition is false, expression2 is executed.

The ternary operator takes three operands, hence, the name ternary operator. It is also known as a conditional operator.

Let's write a program to determine if a student passed or failed in the exam based on marks obtained.


#Ternary operator


=============== JavaScript Loop ================
n programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code.

For example, if you want to show a message 100 times, then you can use a loop. 
It's just a simple example; you can achieve much more with loops.

The syntax of the for loop is:
for (initialExpression; condition; updateExpression) {
    // for loop body
}

1. The initialExpression initializes and/or declares variables and executes only once.
2. The condition is evaluated.
   # If the condition is false, the for loop is terminated.
   # If the condition is true, the block of code inside of the for loop is executed.
3. The updateExpression updates the value of initialExpression when the condition is true.
4. The condition is evaluated again. This process continues until the condition is false.
